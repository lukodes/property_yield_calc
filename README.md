ðŸ§® PropertyYieldCalc
PropertyYieldCalc is a web-based calculator built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS that helps users compare two financial strategies:

Buying a property through financing

Investing the rental savings instead

Users can input financing details (loan amount, monthly payment, property value, expected rent), and the app generates two comparison tables:

ðŸ“ˆ Real estate wealth projection: Shows how much equity the user builds over time with property appreciation.

ðŸ’¹ Investment simulation: Projects how much they could accumulate by investing the difference between the mortgage and rent, including a configurable monthly return rate and vacancy period.

This tool aims to help users make informed decisions about whether to buy or invest.
